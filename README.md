...sporting the minimalistic profile for now. just wrapped up my 3rd FreeCodeCamp certificate - Front End Development Libraries. committing all of my time right now to cleaning up the repos for those 15 projects.

as soon as that's done, it's back to work on the [VORTX API](https://github.com/ephraimsmithdev/vortx)! i'll probably give a little love to my GitHub profile too;)
