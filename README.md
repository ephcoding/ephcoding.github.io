# **READ BEFORE READING**

<details>
<summary><strong><em>Seriously, read it >></em></strong></summary>

## **`House Rules`**

Anything I'm playing close to the vest won't be public. If you can see it, it's fair game.

## ``Quality Control`\*\*

If somethings fucked, I want to know.

## **`Links`**

I'm not affiliated with anybody. Links are for YOU. We'll all get 'there' faster sharing resources.

## **`My Approach(es)`**

- **_Building_**

  - When building something new, my only mission is to find the pain points ASAP. _\* so don't expect it to be 'sexy'_

- **_Learning New Concepts_**

  - If it's **totally** new, I'll probably buy a course. Not to copy code and get the certificate, but to have an outline of the overwhelming amount of shit I now have to learn

- **_Writing Blog Posts_**

  - <\* finish section>
